✅ IMPLEMENTED ROLLBACK SCENARIOS:

1. **Document Upload Fails**: 
   - No user created in auth.users
   - No record in partner_registrations
   - Form shows upload error

2. **User Creation Fails**: 
   - No record in partner_registrations
   - Form shows auth error

3. **Partner Registration Fails (after user created)**:
   - User is deleted from auth.users via API call
   - No record in partner_registrations
   - Form shows rollback status

4. **Complete Success**:
   - User created in auth.users
   - Record created in partner_registrations
   - Documents stored in private bucket
   - Form resets and shows success

🔍 ROLLBACK VERIFICATION POINTS:

- Form tracks createdUserId to know if rollback is needed
- partnerService logs all operations for debugging
- API endpoint /api/auth/delete-user handles user cleanup
- Documents remain in private bucket for audit (secure)
- Comprehensive error messages inform user of status

🚨 TESTING SCENARIOS:

1. **Test Upload Failure**: 
   - Try uploading a file > 10MB
   - Verify no user is created

2. **Test Duplicate Email**: 
   - Register with same email twice
   - Verify second attempt fails cleanly

3. **Test Network Issues**: 
   - Disconnect network after upload
   - Verify user rollback occurs

4. **Test Rate Limiting**: 
   - Submit multiple rapid registrations
   - Verify rate limit handling

📋 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

Form Level (PartnerRegistrationForm.tsx):
- Tracks documentUrls and createdUserId separately
- Calls rollback API if user created but registration failed
- Shows comprehensive error messages
- Documents uploaded to 'registration-documents' private bucket

Service Level (partnerService.ts):
- Creates user first, then registration record
- Automatic rollback on any registration failure
- Enhanced logging for debugging
- Better error message handling

API Level (/api/auth/delete-user.ts):
- Admin-level user deletion
- Proper error handling
- Secure user ID validation

🎯 BENEFITS:

✅ No orphaned users in auth.users table
✅ No orphaned registrations in partner_registrations table  
✅ Documents stored securely in private bucket
✅ Clear error feedback to users
✅ Comprehensive logging for debugging
✅ Rate limit protection
✅ Duplicate email prevention

The registration process is now atomic - either everything succeeds or everything is cleaned up!
